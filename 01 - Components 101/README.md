# Components 101
1. Create two components (one manually AND one with the Angular-CLI) named respectively: WarningAlert and SuccessAlert
2. Output them beneath each other in the AppComponent (the bootstrap component of the root module).
3. Output a warning message or success message in the components 
4. Style the components appropriately (feel free to leverage the Bootstrap default theming).

Use external AND internal templates and style!
